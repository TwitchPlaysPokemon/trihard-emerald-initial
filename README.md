# Pokémon TriHard Emerald

Currently, the idea is that this is a modified version of Emerald that conforms to the following "TriHard" rules:

1. Save option is removed from menu.
2. Pokémon Storage System is inaccessible.
3. Cannot catch Pokémon when party is full
4. Healing at a Pokémon Center (or Mom's/Grandma's house) saves the game
5. When a Pokémon faints, it is immediately moved from the party into the PC (overwriting the oldest Pokémon if the PC is full)
6. When the player whites out, the game resets.
7. When a save file exists, the game loads it immediately upon starting

(Nuzlocke catching requirements are ignored entirely)

Other possible suggestions:

* Give the player infinite Poké balls to prevent winding up stuck with a single underleveled or pacifist Pokémon
* Boost exp earned and/or give exp to the entire party whether they participated or not to reduce the tedium of grinding.

If you feel these rules should be adjusted, add an Issue.
